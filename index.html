    <h1>How to Check Ladki Bahin Yojana Status Online</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://ladkibahin-yojana.org/" target="_blank">ladki bahin yojana</a> is one of Maharashtra’s most impactful welfare schemes designed to support women financially through monthly installments. Thousands of eligible women benefit from this initiative every month, but many are unaware of how to check their payment or application status. This guide explains the complete process for checking the <strong>Ladki Bahin Yojana status</strong> online in 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Check Your Ladki Bahin Yojana Status?</h2>
    <p>
      Verifying your status ensures that your application has been approved and that your payments are being credited correctly. Many beneficiaries face issues like delayed payments, missing installments, or incomplete applications due to errors in bank details or Aadhaar linkage. By checking your status regularly, you can confirm that your details are verified and active in the government system.
    </p>

    <h2>Information You Need Before Checking Status</h2>
    <p>
      Before visiting the official portal to check your status, keep these details ready:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your registered mobile number (linked to Aadhaar)</li>
      <li>Aadhaar number or application ID</li>
      <li>Bank account details (to confirm payment receipt)</li>
      <li>Registration confirmation or acknowledgment number</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Check Ladki Bahin Yojana Status Online</h2>
    <p>
      Follow the simple steps below to check your application or payment status for the year 2025:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit the official portal for the Ladki Bahin Yojana.</li>
      <li>On the homepage, find and click on the “Status Check” option.</li>
      <li>Enter your Aadhaar number or registration ID.</li>
      <li>Verify using the OTP sent to your registered mobile number.</li>
      <li>Once verified, your application details will appear on the screen.</li>
      <li>You’ll see whether your payment has been processed, pending, or on hold.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Details Displayed in the Status Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      After completing the verification process, the dashboard will display key information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beneficiary Name and Registration Number</li>
      <li>Payment Status (Credited, Pending, or Rejected)</li>
      <li>Last Payment Date and Amount</li>
      <li>Bank Account and IFSC Code (masked for security)</li>
      <li>Next Installment Date</li>
      <li>Remarks, if any issues are found with verification</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reasons for Pending or Failed Payments</h2>
    <p>
      If your payment is showing as “pending” or “failed,” don’t panic. The most common reasons include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect Aadhaar or bank account details</li>
      <li>Incomplete eKYC verification</li>
      <li>Inactive or frozen bank account</li>
      <li>Mismatch between applicant and bank account holder names</li>
      <li>Technical delays in the DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can fix most of these issues by completing your eKYC again and ensuring that your Aadhaar number is linked with your active bank account.
    </p>

    <h2>Offline Method to Check Status</h2>
    <p>
      If you don’t have access to the internet or face login issues, you can also check your status offline. Visit your nearest <strong>Gram Panchayat office</strong> or <strong>Seva Kendra</strong> with your Aadhaar card and bank passbook. Officials can check your status using your registration number and verify whether your name appears in the beneficiary list.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Do if Your Application Is Rejected</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes applications are rejected due to missing documents or incorrect information. In such cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in again to the official portal and review your application form.</li>
      <li>Update your Aadhaar, bank, or contact details as required.</li>
      <li>Re-submit your corrected application for re-verification.</li>
      <li>Check again after 7–10 working days to confirm approval.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips to Ensure Smooth Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always complete your eKYC before the deadline.</li>
      <li>Link your Aadhaar number with your active bank account.</li>
      <li>Use the same mobile number throughout your application process.</li>
      <li>Check your payment status regularly to track updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Ladki Bahin Yojana</strong> continues to be a lifeline for thousands of women across Maharashtra, helping them achieve financial independence and stability. By checking your status frequently, you can ensure that your details are verified and payments are being credited without issues.
